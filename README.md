##
Simply look at the camera, and you're marked present! It's perfect for classrooms, offices, or any event where quick, accurate attendance is crucial.

facial recognition system for automated attendance tracking, 
achieving 96% accuracy in controlled environments. Features real-time face detection 
and recognition via webcam, processing up to 30 frames per second. Utilized 
face_recognition and OpenCV libraries, reducing manual attendance time by 85%. 
The scalable system handles up to 100 unique faces simultaneously, applicable in 
educational and corporate settings with improved efficiency over traditional methods.
